This Task Manager application is a full-stack project built with Java and Spring Boot on the backend and ReactJS on the frontend. It allows users to create, view, update, and manage tasks efficiently.It includes features such as task management, search functionality, REST API functionality, Enum Handling, form validation, security, error handling and unit testing.

The backend is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It includes a well-structured RESTful API for task management operations. The user interface is built with ReactJS and uses Axios to make HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend, handling operations such as task creation, retrieval and searching tasks by ID.

This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications using Java for the backend and React for the frontend. It also showcases my knowledge in building and securing REST APIs and applying efficient state management in React.
